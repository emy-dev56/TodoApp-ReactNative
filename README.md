This project is part of my React Native learning journey.
I’m building hands-on projects to strengthen my understanding of mobile development concepts and improve through real practice.

What I practiced in this project:

React Native core components

Functional components and React hooks

State management using useState and useEffect

Component structure and reusability

Styling using Flexbox and StyleSheet

Features included:

Dynamic UI rendering

User interaction handling

Clean and simple layout

Responsive design principles

Compared to my previous projects, I focused more on writing cleaner code and organizing components better.

This project reflects my current learning progress and my commitment to improving my React Native skills step by step.
