# Todo App – React Native

This Todo App is part of my React Native learning journey.  
I build small, practical projects to understand real mobile app structure, state management, and UI behavior through hands-on practice.

## 🚀 What I Practiced

- React Native core components (`View`, `Text`, `TextInput`, `TouchableOpacity`, `FlatList`)
- Functional components and React Hooks
- State management using `useState`
- Handling user input and basic validation
- Rendering dynamic lists efficiently
- Styling using Flexbox and `StyleSheet`
- Organizing components and project structure
- Using context API

## ✨ Features

- Add new todo items
- Display todos dynamically in a list
- Remove completed todos
- Simple and clean user interface
- Edit todos
- Toggle dark and light mode
- Toggle Notifications
- save data to convex (Real time changes)

## 🧠 Learning Focus

Through this project, I focused on writing clearer components, improving readability, and understanding how UI updates are driven by state changes in React Native.

This project represents my current learning progress and my approach of learning by building, iterating, and improving step by step.
